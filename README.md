# Coding-Quiz

Project Description:
The purpose of this challenge was to create a coding quiz with timer. Thanks to Wesley Clements for helping me debug and get my buttons working correctly!

Credits:
Started with code from our bootcamp wk4 activity 7
and used https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/create-a-quiz-app-with-timer-using-html-css-and-javascript/ to help outline and understand the order of operations for creating a page like this. Also got help cleaning things up and debugging from the AI tutor.

Challenges:
I struggled with hiding/unhiding certain sections when called, starting the quiz with the button, and how to structure the questions array so that you would have multiple choice and see one question at a time. I also continue to have syntax struggles that take so much time to find >.< Wesley sent me some resources to get more practice and some tips/tricks to maintain consistent naming and changing.
